# **Stock News Screener - iOS**

**What is it?**

This news screener, programmed in python, runs a web-scraping algorithm that continuously scans two major stocks-related sites - 'Globenewswire', and  'Businesswire'.
The algorithm scans for relevant keywords in headlines of news articles, and if any the keywords are found in a headline, it is shown as a system notification on the computer. The notifications can then be clicked, which will lead the user directly to the news article. The algorithm screens for news
every two seconds using web-scraping and uses the tkinter module in python for the GUI. 

**Who is it for?**

The StockNewsScreener is most useful for stock traders - especially day traders and swing traders given that it provides the user with news within seconds of when it is published.
In short-term trading, many times a jump in stock prices is seen due to a recent news publication regarding a company, and profit can be maximized if one stays on top of any recent news publications using the StockNewsScreener application.
